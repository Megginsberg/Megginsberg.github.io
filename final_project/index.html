 <p>College is some of the best years of our lives! The average college student is often pressed for time, under a lot of stress, and eating on the go. You may find it difficult to avoid bad habits like skipping meals or frequently visiting fast food restaurants. But eating a healthy diet can help you feel better, cope with stress, and perform better in the classroom and on the athletic field. It really isnâ€™t that hard to get started.</p>
