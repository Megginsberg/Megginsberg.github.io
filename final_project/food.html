<li><b>Fruits</b> should always have a place on your grocery list. They are nutritious and also cheaper than most junk food. You can also through them in the blender and make a delicious smoothie. Some great options include: Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Strawberries, Bluberries, Pinneapple, and Frozen fruits.</li>
<li><b>Vegetables</b> are full of nutrients, low in calorie, and full of fiber. You'll fill up faster and won't have to eat as much. Some great ideas are: Carrots, Broccoli, Spinach, Celery, and any Frozen Veggies.</li>
<li><b>Protein</b> is an essential component of your diet. Eating lean meats like chicken is one of the best ways to get protein, but that can be difficult while living in a dorm. Some other great ways to get protein are: Greek yogurt, Penut Butter, Nuts, Quinioa, Black Beans, and Frozen chicken</li>
<li><b>Breads and Grains</b> are meant to be eaten in moderation because they are high in carbohydrates. Always go for whole grain options and limit yourself. Some great ideas are: Whole grain bread or totrtillas (Ezekiel Bread is a great one!), Oatmeal, Whole grain cereal, Granola (less than 8g of sugar) and Brown Rice.
